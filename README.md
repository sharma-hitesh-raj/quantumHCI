# quantumHCI

Welcome to quantumHCI, i.e. Quantum - Human Computer Interaction or as some prefer to call Human Quantum-Computer Interface. Well, I personally prefer putting 'quantum' ahead of HCI for a greater and deeper reason, that will become obvious with progression in the project, so stay curious - stay tunned with this journey to a new paradigm of an alternate realm. 

Hello De-coders,
We all are actually decoding the fabric of existence within our(human's) limited perception by means of different language and then languaging it differently. Here, we are going to develop one such similar approach but with a different perspective and purpose. Interim results and conclusions might fork out to add social and / or economical value to the community, but the collective direction will aim for higher purpose. Looking for Revelations? Its right here and now at your disposal! Open your eyes to it.
Ready for Revealations? Stay connected.

Lets _"Code the de-coding"_!!
