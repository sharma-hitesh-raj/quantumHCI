Quantum Algorithm (QuAL) currently may broadly be grouped into following categories:
1. Siulation of Quantum Systems [Llyod]
2. Breaking of Cryptographic Codes [Shor]
3. Optimising / Combinatorial search [Grover]
4. High Dimenssion Linear Algebra [HHL]
5. Quantum Heuristics [QAOA]

Quantum Algorithm Zoo (https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/) is a comprehensive catalog of quantum algorithms.
