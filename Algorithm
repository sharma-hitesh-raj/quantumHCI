Quantum Algorithm currently may broadly be grouped into following categories:
1. Siulation of Quantum Systems [Llyod]
2. Breaking of Cryptographic Codes [Shor]
3. Optimising / Combinatorial search [Grover]
4. High Dimenssion Linear Algebra [HHL]
5. Quantum Heuristics [QAOA]

Quantum Algorithm Zoo (https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/) is a comprehensive catalog of quantum algorithms.

A. Algebraic and Number Theoretic Algorithms [Factoring
B. Oracular Algorithms 
C. Approximation and Simulation Algorithms
D. Optimization, Numerics, and Machine Learning
